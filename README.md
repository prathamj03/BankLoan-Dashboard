### Problem Statement:
"In order to monitor and assess bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

## KPIs Requirements:
1.Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2.Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

3.Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

4.Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

## Good Loan Vs Bad Loans KPIs:
1.Good/Bad Loan Application Percentage: We need to calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good or Bad Loans.'

2.Good/Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good/ Bad Loan' category.

3.Good/Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good/Bad Loans.'

4.Good/Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good/Bad Loans,'.
